Purpose:
This example implements Pulse Width Modulation Test modules on LPC11Uxx

Running mode:
* Build, Debug

Output:
P0_7 toggles continuosly.
Also CT32_1 MAT0 and CT16_1 MAT1 output waveforms with frequency 48KHz but with duty cycles 25% and 50% respectively.

Note:
PWM frequency used = 48KHz
