Purpose:
To implement EEPROM API calls on LPC11U2x and above

Running mode:
* Make, Download,Debug
* Setup UART for 9600, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit

Note:
Tested with NGX LPC11U24 board.

Output:

LPC11Uxx eepromAPI test
'd' - Display Contents of EEPROM (Little Endian)
'f' - Fill EEPROM with 0xFF
'0' - Fill EEPROM with 0x00
'c' - Fill EEPROM with incrementing bytes
't' - Fill EEPROM with timestamps
